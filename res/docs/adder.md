Adder is a CAD program, for modeling 3d objects.

It's come about with some greviences my spiteful ass has got against the current state of the art.

1. CAD programs are ugly
2. CAD programs aren't built to be used quickly
3. CAD programs are hard to learn
4. CAD programs are laggy and buggy
5. CAD programs don't let you keep your files
6. CAD programs are not as powerful as they could be.

And with all that I decided I'd take a crack at building one myself.
