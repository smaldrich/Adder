Sketches are where you start when making an object.
They are a 2d drawing of what one face might look like, and are built out of lines and constraints.

It's reccomended  that you create all the geometry you want using the line tool, then constrain it down.

Once you have a sketch that works, you can go on and make it 3d using one of the following tools:
[extrude.md]
[revolve.md]
[loft.md]

Don't worry if the dimensions aren't perfect, or even the shape. You can always go back and change these
without ruining the rest of the design by using the [timeline].
