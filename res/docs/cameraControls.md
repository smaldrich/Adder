In general:
    Use RMB to rotate the camera
    Use Shift+RMB to pan around
    Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

I decided against middle mouse because most trackpads don't have one, and adder is indended to be useable anywhere.
Also, right mouse takes less force to press than most middle buttons, which is nice when you're using it all the time.

For almost anything else (especially changing the roll of the camera), you'll want look at.
V (look at), aligns the camera to a piece of geometry that you have selected. (I.E. select first, then press V).
    - selecting a face will point the camera at that face
    - selecting a corner will center the cameras pivot on a corner
    - selecting an edge will roll the camera so that that edge is vertical or horizontal (use if selecting a face put you at a wierd roll).

When looking at an edge snaps wrong, you can use shift+Q or shift+E to roll the camera 90 degrees left or right respectively.

These should cover everything you need, have fun!
